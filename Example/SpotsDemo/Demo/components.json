A successful advertising campaign is created when the strategy triggers good ideas that meet technology and create engagement in the target group. We define a team according to the job that needs to be done. Not according to the job title on a business card.\n\nThe traditional advertisement no longer exists – but the tradition of good advertisements lives on in the best of health. A clear message presented in a creative and engaging manner will always be the basis of a good advertisement. But we must have the confidence of consumers, and a survey conducted by Nielsen shows that big changes are afoot. When consumers were asked who they trusted, the answer was sensational. Only 37% trust what an advertisement says (and here the trend was downwards), 57% trust what they read on your website, 80% trust what they themselves read in social media, while as many as 97% trust information from their own friends in social media. Hyper works multi-directionally to make sure your story is credible, engaging and gets out there, often as a combination of film, ads, social media, own channels and in many cases, using games.",

        "subtitle" : "The digital revolution opens up the possibility of completely new ways of building up and developing an organisation. Through communication, training and culture building.\n\nThere is enormous power in building up a strong business culture. The management should cultivate a culture of openness, knowledge sharing, discussion and experience. We can do this through, among other things, transferring the way we communicate in social media to our internal communication. We make engaging internal communication solutions with quality content. You want to create ambassadors. We can help you do that.\n\nTo perform well, you have to train a lot and have the opportunity to practise. Athletes put in thousands of hours of training every year in order to perform at top level. Good management involves training your employees in focusing on the right things, to be good decision-makers, to become rich in knowledge. No one thrives by making decisions on things they can’t carry through or know nothing about. It’s not very efficient to make the wrong decisions – and it can be costly. Good training is necessary for being able to perform.\n\nA marketing manager who does not actively seek cooperation with the rest of the organisation will pretty soon be out of a job. These days it’s no longer enough to just pay to get your message out there. You have to be a brand. The advertisements must reflect brand perception in social media, in customer services, on individual websites, and, not least, must be firmly anchored in their own organisation. The responsibility for building up a brand or selling a product may just as easily rest with IT, HR, product development, customer services, in stores or in production. There was never a better time for taking the employees seriously with regard to opinion, communication and marketing work.\n\nWe make use of social media, digital 3D games and mobile intranet solutions for in-house training, communication, knowledge sharing and self-motivation. We create engagement around learning and skills development internally. Every single employee is allowed to train, learn, participate, compete, and perhaps most important of all – share from their own working day, and be seen. This builds up a culture of winners.\n\nWe have a good understanding of business and can see how things are connected. We also know that efficiency is all about things other than just monetary value.",

               "subtitle" : "Today’s technology has given us completely new possibilities for developing products. For many people, the website, app or mobile solution has become the actual core product. Sometimes it is this product that has to be improved. Just think how important Apple software has been for the experience of the Apple brand. Sometimes it is a brand new product solution, and sometimes you can productify an idea, a concept or a solution.\n\nEveryone is willing to pay for digital products and solutions. Who has not bought music, streamed a video, downloaded an app, or bought something online? Marketing a digital service is as much about developing the product itself as it is about the history that you share. It’s about design, functionality and user experience, combined with a credible history. Facebook is a good example of something where functional innovation goes hand in hand with the story of a young man with a hoodie at the stock exchange.\n\nEven products that are not digital have a digital life. The consumer will share information about your product, whether that product is a mobile phone, a garment or a carton of milk. Tine’s Mr. Melk (Mr Milk) has over ⅓ of young people in Norway as friends on Facebook, he has had two number one hits on Spotify and over 1 million people have downloaded his game Mr. Melk Winter Games. Or what about a ski helmet with a built-in camera that can share, live, an off-piste experience from the Norwegian mountains with the rest of the world.\n\n If you involve your customers in the actual product development, they will be more likely to be loyal and act as brand ambassadors for you. Hyper has developed a program for monitoring social media with over 30,000 subscribers across the world. We have developed an innovative sales support system for Dansani. We have developed a separate children’s traffic club for NAF, the Norwegian Automobile Association. We have launched commercial games in the AppStore. We have developed new saving products for the LandkredittBank and we have developed a number of web-based services for communication, file sharing and dialogue.",
